In this folder, I have **only included** the files which I modified (refer back to individual report), **not** the entire github repo for gaze-estimation (https://github.com/yakhyo/gaze-estimation/). This is to reduce the size of my repo and make it easier for you to view. If you wish to run the code, you will need to follow the instructions on https://github.com/yakhyo/gaze-estimation/ and replace the `helpers.py` file and the `detect.py` file with the ones I have in this repo.
